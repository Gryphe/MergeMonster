# Strategies:
# "cumulative" - Default strategy. If there's a chance of reducing the combined probability, accept the merge.
# "all_phrases" - Only accept the merge if all phrases show an improvement. (Warning: This rarely happens)
# "quantitive" - Ignores probabilities completely. Only looks at how many phrases show an improvement, as defined by the threshold below.
strategy: "cumulative"
# Threshold is currently only used by the "quantitive" strategy. If 0.6, at least 60% of the number of phrases must show am improvement.
